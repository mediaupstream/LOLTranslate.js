## LOLTranslate - Javascript based LOLCat Translator
---
  
#### Usage:

Include this file in your project source and now you can translate a string
to LolSpeak like so  

	var catSays = LOLTranslate('Hello World'); 
	console.log(catSays); // outputs 'OH HAI WIRRLD'

You can pass false as a second param to return lowercase output:  

	var catSays = LOLTranslate('Hello World', false);
	console.log(catSays); // outputs 'oh hai wurrld'

Also check out the `bookmarklet.js` script, use it to LOLTranslate entire webpages on the fly :)
